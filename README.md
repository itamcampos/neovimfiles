# My Neovim configuration files

Files are constantly updating to experience new features, so make sure there are no conflicts with your current settings.

The currently configured and active color scheme is "One Dark" provided by user [Navarasu](https://github.com/navarasu/onedark.nvim).

## Important

If you already have custom settings for Neovim, it is likely that the settings in this repository will not integrate with your current settings, in which case you would need to backup and delete your Neovim settings before using this repository.

## Currently installed plugins:

- [One Dark](https://github.com/navarasu/onedark.nvim) is the currently active color scheme.

- [Fern](https://github.com/lambdalisue/vim-fern), pronounced "furn", is a general-purpose asynchronous tree viewer written in pure Vim script.

- [Fix CursorHold](https://github.com/antoinemadec/FixCursorHold.nvim) to fix performance bugs with "autocmd" events.
